# Supermarket Simulation

Welcome to the Supermarket Simulation project! This simulation provides a dynamic and realistic representation of a supermarket environment, focusing on customer behavior, queue dynamics, and service point utilization.

## Overview

The Supermarket Simulation project is designed to offer valuable insights into the operational aspects of a supermarket. By modeling and analyzing customer interactions, queue dynamics, and service point utilization, the simulation aims to contribute to the optimization of service delivery and resource utilization within a supermarket setting.

## Features

- **Customer Behavior:** Simulates individual customers with attributes such as arrival time, the number of items in their cart, and a unique identifier.
- **Queue Dynamics:** Models queues at various service points within the supermarket, reflecting real-world scenarios.
- **Service Point Utilization:** Represents the duration a customer spends at a service point, including processing time by supermarket staff.

## Tools Used

- **Programming Language:** Java
- **GUI Library:** JavaFX
- **Database Connectivity:** JDBC for MariaDB

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Java and JavaFX installed.
2. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/Supermarket-Simulation.git`
3. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Supermarket-Simulation`
4. Run the simulation: `mvn clean javafx:run -Dexec.mainClass=com.supermarket.simulation.main.Main`
